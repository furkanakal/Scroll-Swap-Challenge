# Assignment

You're doing great! You have;
1. initialized your Foundry project,
2. learned what ERC20 tokens are
3. grasped the functionality of ERC20 tokens,
4. learned what kind of Solidity syntax you will need.

## Objective

Your task is to;
1. build your own ERC20 token,
2. deploy it to Scroll Sepolia Testnet,
3. and finally verify it.

If you don't remember exactly what kind of structures you need to build, don't worry! Quickly get back to [the Guide](./Guide.md) and continue building.
