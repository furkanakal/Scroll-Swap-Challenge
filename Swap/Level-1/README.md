1. Guide: Begin your journey with the guide. Here you'll find how to get started.

2. Assignment: Finally, advance to the assignment. You can put your knowledge to the test by creating and deploying your own DeFi swap contract with Foundry.

## Challenge Levels

### Level 1: Mastering the Basics in Swapping

#### ðŸ“š `Formula`
**Objective**: Dive deep into the world of DeFi automated market making. Here, you'll grasp the core concepts that form the backbone of decentralized swapping.

#### ðŸ’» `Syntax`
**Objective**: Hone your Solidity skills. Solidity is the language of Ethereum, and mastering its syntax is key to building robust smart contracts.
- Brush up on your Solidity syntax and learn about state variables, functions, mappings, and more.
- We've packed this folder with exercises and examples that will sharpen your coding skills.

#### ðŸ”§ `Assignment`
**Objective**: Put theory into practice. It's time to get your hands dirty and build your basic swap contract using Foundry!
- You'll start from scratch, and by the end, you'll have a working DeFi swap smart contract.
- Follow the instructions within the directory to set up your environment, write your contract, and test it to perfection.

## How to Succeed in This Challenge ðŸŒŸ

1. **Start with Understanding**: Grasping the fundamentals of DeFi swapping and automated market making is crucial. Don't rush through this part; the knowledge you gain here will be the foundation of everything you build.

2. **Practice Makes Perfect**: Solidity might be new to you, or you may need a refresher. Either way, practice diligently. Try out the different syntaxes, and don't be afraid to experiment.

3. **Learn by Doing**: There's no better way to learn than by getting your hands dirty. Building a contract from scratch will solidify your understanding and give you practical experience.

4. **Seek Help When Needed**: Stuck? That's completely okay! Reach out in the telegram group or refer to the `defi_fundamentals` and `syntax` directories.

5. **Enjoy the Process**: Remember, learning something new is always a journey. Enjoy each step, celebrate your progress, and keep pushing forward.

## Conclusion

This mission isn't just about learning; it's about transforming yourself into a confident participant in the DeFi space. By the end of this mission, you'll not only have a deeper understanding of DeFi lending but also hands-on experience in building a DeFi swap contract. So, are you ready to take on this mission and emerge as a DeFi aficionado? Let's do this! ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ

Remember, the mission is as rewarding as the destination. Embrace the challenge, and let's revolutionize the world of finance together! ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¼ðŸ“ˆ
