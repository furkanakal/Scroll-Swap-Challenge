# Assignment

You're doing awesome! You have;
1. learned what staking reward is and how it works,
2. implemented a rewarding mechanism into your basic staking contract.

## Objective

Your task is to;
1. define new necessary variables that you had learned in the Guide,
2. build the `rewardPerToken()`, `earned()`, and `claimReward()` functions,
3. deploy your contract to Scroll Sepolia Testnet,
4. and finally verify it.

If you don't remember exactly what kind of structures you need to build, don't worry! Quickly get back to [the Guide](./Guide.md) and continue building.
