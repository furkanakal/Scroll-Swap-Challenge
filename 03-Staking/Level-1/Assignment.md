# Assignment

You're doing great! You have;
1. initialized your Foundry project,
2. learned what crypto staking is,
3. learned which functions you will build,
4. learned what kind of Solidity syntax you will need.

## Objective

Your task is to;
1. build `stake()` and `withdraw()` functions,
2. deploy your contract to Scroll Sepolia Testnet,
3. and finally verify it.

If you don't remember exactly what kind of structures you need to build, don't worry! Quickly get back to [the Guide](./Guide.md) and continue building.
